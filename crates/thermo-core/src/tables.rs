//! Packed-key lookup helpers for the generated DNA energy tables.
//!
//! Keys in `parameters_dna` are short ACGT strings (2–8 bases).  We pack each
//! base as 2 bits (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3, U treated as T) LSB-first, exactly
//! mirroring `native/codegen_tables.py::pack`, and binary-search the sorted
//! generated arrays.  This avoids building any map at runtime: lookups are
//! ≤ log2(N) comparisons on static data (≤ 14 for the 9216-entry 2×2 table).
