# contains an em dash, forcing a rewrite before the turn is allowed to
# finish. AGENTS.md has a zero-tolerance em dash rule, but relying on
# Claude to self-check its own output proved unreliable (four violations
# in one session, including immediately after promising to check more
# carefully). This enforces the rule at the harness level instead.
